The recruiter can share more details about compensation for the role in your location during the hiring process.\n\nU.S. employees have access to quality medical, dental and vision insurance, a 401(k) plan with a Cisco matching contribution, short and long-term disability coverage, basic life insurance and numerous wellbeing offerings. Employees receive up to twelve paid holidays per calendar year, which includes one floating holiday, plus a day off for their birthday. Employees accrue up to 20 days of Paid Time Off (PTO) each year and have access to paid time away to deal with critical or emergency issues without tapping into their PTO. We offer additional paid time to volunteer and give back to the community. Employees are also able to purchase company stock through our Employee Stock Purchase Program.\n\nEmployees on sales plans earn performance-based incentive pay on top of their base salary, which is split between quota and non-quota components. For quota-based incentive pay, Cisco pays at the standard rate of 1% of incentive target for each 1% revenue attainment against the quota up to 100%. Once performance exceeds 100% quota attainment, incentive rates may increase up to five times the standard rate with no cap on incentive compensation. For non-quota-based sales performance elements such as strategic sales objectives, Cisco may pay up to 125% of target. Cisco sales plans do not have a minimum threshold of performance for sales incentive compensation to be paid.",

Individual pay is determined by the candidate's hiring location and additional factors, including but not limited to skillset, experience, and relevant education, certifications, or training.

This is a highly-creative position; the Developer will be expected not only to write code but to participate actively in design decisions, and ultimately, to take ownership of significant portions of the applications\u2019 functionality. A critical aspect of this position is the ability to understand and develop a sophisticated web-based application holistically \u2013 that is, the Full Stack Developer will be writing code on both the front end (in JavaScript/CSS/HTML, running in a web browser) and the back end (running on servers). Making the position even more interesting, 1010data\u2019s back end is written in K, a very powerful, array-based/list-oriented language. (Knowing K is not a requirement for hiring, but keen interest in learning and working in a new, unconventional language is.) The expectation is that the Developer will start out working primarily on front-end code while learning K and the ins and outs of the back-end with mentoring from the rest of the team.\n\nThis role is not sponsorable\n\nWhat You Will Take On\n\u2022 Write high-quality code\n\u2022 Diligently work to familiarize yourself with an unconventional programming language, codebase, and way of thinking about data analytics\n\u2022 Participate actively and outspokenly in the application design process\n\u2022 Share your experience and skill with the rest of the team\n\u2022 Strive to take the user viewpoint \u2013 understand how users will use the application and be guided in your decisions by that understanding\n\u2022 Communicate clearly with QA and documentation teams and with users and business stakeholders\n\u2022 Assist in recruiting new team members\n\u2022 Effectively collaborate with geographically dispersed, cross-functional teams\n\nWhat You Already Have\n\u2022 5-10 years of experience as a full stack developer\n\u2022 Curiosity, initiative, independence, and an open mind.\n\u2022 A love of writing beautiful code to do beautiful things, and pride in the code you write. (It makes you happy that your colleagues love integrating with your code and the users love using it.)\n\u2022 A scientific approach to solving problems \u2013 you don\u2019t just assume, you experiment, and then make decisions based on the data.\n\u2022 Skills relevant to writing web-based user interfaces, both on the front end and the back end. You have a strong understanding of HTML/JS/CSS/WebSocket and other web technologies, and also experience with enough general-purpose programming languages (e.g. C and C-family languages, Java, Python, \u2026.) that you won\u2019t blink at learning a new one.\n\u2022 Interest in/experience with non-mainstream programming languages, such as array languages (e.g. APL, J, K, q); list-oriented languages (e.g. Lisp, Clojure); rule-based languages (e.g. Wolfram/Mathematica), and/or functional languages. (We use K, an array-based/list-oriented language, extensively at 1010.)\n\u2022 Interest in/experience with data analytics and visualization, distributed computing, databases, or scientific computing/high performance computing, data science, \u201cAI,\u201d \u201cML,\u201d (whatever you may perceive those to be), statistics. (This is what the software we\u2019re writing is used for.)\n\u2022 A strongly self-disciplined approach to software development. (For example, you test carefully, put thought into your commit messages, and don\u2019t feel your work is complete until you\u2019ve documented it.)\n\u2022 \u201cA feel for the machine\u201d \u2013 and the network. An understanding of how to write software that gets the most out of the hardware, but is tolerant of its occasional failures.\n\u2022 A passion for performance. (Shaving seconds of a calculation \u2013 or milliseconds of a UI interaction -- gives you a sense of accomplishment.)\n\u2022 A strong aesthetic sensibility. (A clunky or ugly interface \u2013 or clunky or ugly code \u2013 makes you feel uncomfortable.)\n\nThe expected base salary range for this position is from $100,000 - $160,000. It is not typical for offers to be made at or near the top of the range. Salary offers are based on a wide range of factors including relevant skills, training, experience, education, geography, and where applicable, certifications obtained. Market and organizational factors are also considered. In addition to salary and a generous employee benefits package, successful candidates may also be eligible to receive discretionary annual performance bonus compensation.\n\nAbout 1010data\n\nFor more than 20 years, 1010data has helped financial, retail and consumer goods customers monitor shifts in consumer demand and market conditions and rapidly respond with highly targeted strategies.
