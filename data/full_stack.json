The duration of this position is 12+ Months.\nCompany Description:\nCome join a company that is defining space communications and driving internet access across the globe. Remote environment? Moving vehicle? Not a problem. This multi-billion-dollar organization launches, maintains, and harnesses the power of satellites to provide connectivity in the most rural and underdeveloped areas, or in airplanes thousands of feet above the nearest cell phone tower.\nAnyone can claim to have a cool mission or buy a ticket to space. What really defines a company is how they treat people. Company culture and bad management are some of the top drivers of turnover. This place gets it. They've been ranked by Glassdoor as one of the top 100 companies in America to work for 14 years in a row. And they don't just treat people near the top well, Thrillist has ranked them as one of the companies offering the highest paying internships and entry level jobs. Their median tenure is five years, and they have a reputation for promoting from within. And in converting their contractors to full time-employees once they finish projects. All this adds up to a top-notch culture and a place where you actually want to work, so you can spend more time putting your feet up and less time updating your resume!\nSummary:\nThe Full Stack Developer will work on both the front and back-end, with an emphasis on React front-end development (65/35 front-end/back-end split). This team is very committed to helping their engineers become well-rounded, so a willingness to try all aspects of the stack is a must. Depending on what aspects of the tech you gravitate towards, you will be given opportunities to shine. Many developers have started their enterprise careers on this team and moved around and up within the company, with this as their launch pad.",

The founders, former Intelligence Community technology executives, have built the kind of company they always wanted to be part of. The most unusual aspect is that people move freely from project to project - in addition to their 20+ vehicles for DIA and CIA work and their commercial customers, the CEO often can literally pick up the phone, call the customer, and get added to new work that interests an employee.\n\nThey help their people change projects all the time: you don't get stuck in one role for years (unless you want to stay in it). And wouldn't it be nice to be somewhere where you don't have to worry about a layoff if a project ends? The work itself is also amazing and as close to the mission as you will find - Data Science and Analytics work, counter terrorism, counter proliferation, targeting, virtual operations, exploits, HUMINT research and other missions.\n\nThey prime on several programs and also have a number of subcontracts, and they always need TS/SCI + FS Poly Data Scientists, Data Engineers, Data Analysts, Analytic / Big Data Software Engineers, Full Stack Developers, Cloud Engineers, and Systems Administrators in Reston, Chantilly, McLean, and other sites in Virginia. Salaries here are quite good, plus a 10% 401(k) contribution, 7 weeks of PTO, and excellent health/medical/dental coverage.\n\nIt's a unique combination of great work, great people, and great compensation - low bureaucracy, technology agnostic, massively mission-focused, and extremely well-funded. And during your interview process, the CEO can meet you high-side to talk about the specifics of what they do.",

The founders, former Intelligence Community technology executives, have built the kind of company they always wanted to be part of. The most unusual aspect is that people move freely from project to project - in addition to their 20+ vehicles for DIA and CIA work and their commercial customers, the CEO often can literally pick up the phone, call the customer, and get added to new work that interests an employee.\n\nThey help their people change projects all the time: you don't get stuck in one role for years (unless you want to stay in it). And wouldn't it be nice to be somewhere where you don't have to worry about a layoff if a project ends? The work itself is also amazing and as close to the mission as you will find - Data Science and Analytics work, counter terrorism, counter proliferation, targeting, virtual operations, exploits, HUMINT research and other missions.\n\nThey prime on several programs and also have a number of subcontracts, and they always need TS/SCI + FS Poly Data Scientists, Data Engineers, Data Analysts, Analytic / Big Data Software Engineers, Full Stack Developers, Cloud Engineers, and Systems Administrators in Reston, Chantilly, McLean, and other sites in Virginia. Salaries here are quite good, plus a 10% 401(k) contribution, 7 weeks of PTO, and excellent health/medical/dental coverage.\n\nIt's a unique combination of great work, great people, and great compensation - low bureaucracy, technology agnostic, massively mission-focused, and extremely well-funded. And during your interview process, the CEO can meet you high-side to talk about the specifics of what they do.",
