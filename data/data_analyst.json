It's nice when other functional units are happy to see you because you're providing an additional resource to support them. And I'd say that's my most favorite piece of being on this team.\n\nRyan\nSocial Worker, LCSW\n\nDescription\n\nProvidence St. Joseph Health is calling a Senior Business Data Analyst, Revenue Cycle to work remotely within our footprint states: AK, CA, MT, OR, TX and/or WA.\n\nThe Sr. Business Data Analyst supports Enterprise Revenue Cycle goals by conducting analytics-oriented projects. The Sr Business Data Analyst pursues the answering of \"why\" questions, provides advisory services to stakeholders and assists customers through interpretation of information. A genuine curiosity of data drives the Business Analyst Sr to seek insights, threats and opportunities for Enterprise Revenue Cycle and Finance.\n\nThe Sr Business Data Analyst will excel in the key components of the analytics project lifecycle including intake management, requirements gathering, data querying, data manipulation & analysis, validation, effectively communicating findings and documentation. Similarly, the role requires the effective management of concurrent work items, escalating blocks when appropriate and meeting targeted delivery dates. Contributions to overall deliverable integrity will be promoted through Quality Assurance of other Analysts' work. Deliverables will range from small, targeted ad-hoc analyses to large scale projects. The Data Analyst Sr may be expected to serve as an accountable lead on projects. Assignments will include serving as a representative of the Data & Insights team at meetings, workgroups, etc. For individual, and overall team success the role requires a high degree of interaction with other RC Data & Insights practice areas. Opportunities for self-directed research will allow the Business Analyst Sr to pursue new avenues of data exploration. While Revenue Cycle data is the core of most analyses, this role requires the ability to leverage many other data areas (Finance, clinical, etc.) and data types (database, files, non-standard, etc.).\n\nThe objective for this role is to provide data analysis and advisory services to Data & Advisory customers. The scope of work may span the entire organization with a strong focus on Revenue Cycle and Finance. A significant portion of the work portfolio involves answering \"why questions\". Our customers expect our team to help them gain understanding of reports and metrics and specifically, unexplainable behavior in those data. To do this, the Business Analyst Sr will employ analytics techniques to understand the problem, leverage appropriate data, discover causality, and effectively communicate to the customer. Other portfolio efforts include advising stakeholders on potential actions based on analyses and involve assisting customers through interpretive/guidance of D&I products.\n\nAt the middle of the range, this role requires strong knowledge of revenue cycle, healthcare and finance data, and a working knowledge of at least three RC functions. The Business Analyst Sr must possess the technical skills to interact with, and draw data from, source systems, data warehouses, etc. The analyst is proficient with reporting software and can easily express visualizations in Tableau or Power BI. At this level, there is an expectation that findings and recommendations can be created in suitable platforms and effectively delivered to audiences at all levels of the organization. All elements of the analytics lifecycle are understood and practiced. Deliverables are appropriately documented and archived for potential recovery/re-use. May be asked to partner with consultants on targeted projects. The Business Analyst Sr cultivates relationships with key business-based resources, customers and stakeholders. The Business Analyst Sr is assigned the more difficult and complex deliverables in the team's portfolio and often mentors analytics Business Analysts.\n\nThe Business Analyst Sr can describe complex data to non-technical colleagues, and works independently, in an organized, self-directed, efficient manner to deliver multiple competing priorities. The ability to effectively and graphically communicate complex data to both individuals and groups is required.\n\nThe Business Analyst Sr performs all duties in a manner which promotes teamwork and reflects the mission and philosophy of Providence St Joseph Health.\n\u2022 Fulfill requests to the Analytics and Advisory team by clarifying requirements, drawing data, developing findings, communicating results, and documenting deliverables.\n\u2022 Excels in the key components of the analytics project lifecycle.\n\u2022 Assists customers through interpretation of reports, data, etc.\n\u2022 Advises stakeholders on potential action items based on analytics findings.\n\u2022 Provides QA on team member\u2019s products.\n\u2022 Collaborates with other Data & Insights teams, both gaining/providing support, information, etc.\n\nRequired qualifications:\n\u2022 Bachelor's Degree in Computer science, mathematics, statistics, information technology, health informatics, public health, or related subject or equivalent educ, experience\n\u2022 5 years strong SQL programming skills.
