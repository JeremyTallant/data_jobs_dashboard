      <td>We're a small digital design and development agency that makes apps, websites, and other fun stuff in the West Town area. You can view some of what we do at http://www.thisismess.com.  We're looking to grow our small but mighty development team. You'll get to work on range of projects, for a great list of clients as well as some of our own homegrown products and services.  You'll be working with our creative team to concept, create and perfect the things we make for our clients, building responsive, emotive, interactive web sites and apps.  Skills &amp; requirements  We're looking for a close-to-full-stack developer to add to our development team. You can either be the type of person who obsesses about the front-end work, or obsesses about the backend, so long as, when necessary, you can dive into the other side of the pool.  You absolutely must have experience with Python and Django. Multiple years of experience. You have to have built applications in Python, and in Django, and have opinions on the best way to do that.  Day to day, we build lots of one-off content management systems for projects, as well as crazy things that have to connect to our custom platforms. You'll be the person building most of these, as well as helping us architect the reusable bits we use project-to-project.  We're a project shop, so you should probably enjoy jumping around on different things, and getting a fresh start every few weeks. This is definitely not a position for people who love to focus on making one thing awesome, but for people who enjoy the challenges of making lots of things pretty awesome, and who like to evolve their toolset and approaches over time.  Really, the "ideal" candidate only needs to a handful of things: • HTML • SASS / CSS • JavaScript • Vue.js, or React (but we use Vue.js) • Python • Django  Additionally, you should be interested in Kubernetes, and continuous delivery, since that's how we roll at Mess.  Finally, we're really focusing on people who have had previous experience working in an agency, or at least a few years of day-in, day-out freelance projects. We'll consider everyone, regardless of experience, but your chances are gonna be way, way, way higher if you didn't just finish a bootcamp last month where you built one Rails app.  About Mess  We may be a bit biased, but it's a great place to work. We strive to keep a semblance of work/life balance. We offer all the basics benefits wise (health, dental, 401k, a vast assortment of snacks, work from home, etc.).</td>

Ryan Social Worker, LCSW  Description  Providence St. Joseph Health is calling a Senior Business Data Analyst, Revenue Cycle to work remotely within our footprint states: AK, CA, MT, OR, TX and/or WA.  The Sr. Business Data Analyst supports Enterprise Revenue Cycle goals by conducting analytics-oriented projects. The Sr Business Data Analyst pursues the answering of "why" questions, provides advisory services to stakeholders and assists customers through interpretation of information. A genuine curiosity of data drives the Business Analyst Sr to seek insights, threats and opportunities for Enterprise Revenue Cycle and Finance.  The Sr Business Data Analyst will excel in the key components of the analytics project lifecycle including intake management, requirements gathering, data querying, data manipulation &amp; analysis, validation, effectively communicating findings and documentation. Similarly, the role requires the effective management of concurrent work items, escalating blocks when appropriate and meeting targeted delivery dates. Contributions to overall deliverable integrity will be promoted through Quality Assurance of other Analysts' work. Deliverables will range from small, targeted ad-hoc analyses to large scale projects. The Data Analyst Sr may be expected to serve as an accountable lead on projects. Assignments will include serving as a representative of the Data &amp; Insights team at meetings, workgroups, etc. For individual, and overall team success the role requires a high degree of interaction with other RC Data &amp; Insights practice areas. Opportunities for self-directed research will allow the Business Analyst Sr to pursue new avenues of data exploration. While Revenue Cycle data is the core of most analyses, this role requires the ability to leverage many other data areas (Finance, clinical, etc.) and data types (database, files, non-standard, etc.).  The objective for this role is to provide data analysis and advisory services to Data &amp; Advisory customers. The scope of work may span the entire organization with a strong focus on Revenue Cycle and Finance. A significant portion of the work portfolio involves answering "why questions". Our customers expect our team to help them gain understanding of reports and metrics and specifically, unexplainable behavior in those data. To do this, the Business Analyst Sr will employ analytics techniques to understand the problem, leverage appropriate data, discover causality, and effectively communicate to the customer. Other portfolio efforts include advising stakeholders on potential actions based on analyses and involve assisting customers through interpretive/guidance of D&amp;I products.  At the middle of the range, this role requires strong knowledge of revenue cycle, healthcare and finance data, and a working knowledge of at least three RC functions. The Business Analyst Sr must possess the technical skills to interact with, and draw data from, source systems, data warehouses, etc. The analyst is proficient with reporting software and can easily express visualizations in Tableau or Power BI. At this level, there is an expectation that findings and recommendations can be created in suitable platforms and effectively delivered to audiences at all levels of the organization. All elements of the analytics lifecycle are understood and practiced. Deliverables are appropriately documented and archived for potential recovery/re-use. May be asked to partner with consultants on targeted projects. The Business Analyst Sr cultivates relationships with key business-based resources, customers and stakeholders. The Business Analyst Sr is assigned the more difficult and complex deliverables in the team's portfolio and often mentors analytics Business Analysts.

The Full Stack Developer, as part of a small team, will help us design and build a new web-based user interface for 1010data’s advanced analytics platform. This is a highly-creative position; the Developer will be expected not only to write code but to participate actively in design decisions, and ultimately, to take ownership of significant portions of the applications’ functionality. A critical aspect of this position is the ability to understand and develop a sophisticated web-based application holistically – that is, the Full Stack Developer will be writing code on both the front end (in JavaScript/CSS/HTML, running in a web browser) and the back end (running on servers). Making the position even more interesting, 1010data’s back end is written in K, a very powerful, array-based/list-oriented language. (Knowing K is not a requirement for hiring, but keen interest in learning and working in a new, unconventional language is.) The expectation is that the Developer will start out working primarily on front-end code while learning K and the ins and outs of the back-end with mentoring from the rest of the team.  This role is not sponsorable  What You Will Take On • Write high-quality code • Diligently work to familiarize yourself with an unconventional programming language, codebase, and way of thinking about data analytics • Participate actively and outspokenly in the application design process • Share your experience and skill with the rest of the team • Strive to take the user viewpoint – understand how users will use the application and be guided in your decisions by that understanding • Communicate clearly with QA and documentation teams and with users and business stakeholders • Assist in recruiting new team members • Effectively collaborate with geographically dispersed, cross-functional teams  What You Already Have • 5-10 years of experience as a full stack developer • Curiosity, initiative, independence, and an open mind. • A love of writing beautiful code to do beautiful things, and pride in the code you write. (It makes you happy that your colleagues love integrating with your code and the users love using it.) • A scientific approach to solving problems – you don’t just assume, you experiment, and then make decisions based on the data. • Skills relevant to writing web-based user interfaces, both on the front end and the back end. You have a strong understanding of HTML/JS/CSS/WebSocket and other web technologies, and also experience with enough general-purpose programming languages (e.g. C and C-family languages, Java, Python, ….) that you won’t blink at learning a new one. • Interest in/experience with non-mainstream programming languages, such as array languages (e.g. APL, J, K, q); list-oriented languages (e.g. Lisp, Clojure); rule-based languages (e.g. Wolfram/Mathematica), and/or functional languages. (We use K, an array-based/list-oriented language, extensively at 1010.) • Interest in/experience with data analytics and visualization, distributed computing, databases, or scientific computing/high performance computing, data science, “AI,” “ML,” (whatever you may perceive those to be), statistics. (This is what the software we’re writing is used for.) • A strongly self-disciplined approach to software development. (For example, you test carefully, put thought into your commit messages, and don’t feel your work is complete until you’ve documented it.) • “A feel for the machine” – and the network. An understanding of how to write software that gets the most out of the hardware, but is tolerant of its occasional failures. • A passion for performance. (Shaving seconds of a calculation – or milliseconds of a UI interaction -- gives you a sense of accomplishment.) • A strong aesthetic sensibility. (A clunky or ugly interface – or clunky or ugly code – makes you feel uncomfortable.)  The expected base salary range for this position is from $100,000 - $160,000. It is not typical for offers to be made at or near the top of the range. Salary offers are based on a wide range of factors including relevant skills, training, experience, education, geography, and where applicable, certifications obtained. Market and organizational factors are also considered. In addition to salary and a generous employee benefits package, successful candidates may also be eligible to receive discretionary annual performance bonus compensation.
